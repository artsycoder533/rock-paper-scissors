Rock Paper Scissors Command Line Game

This purpose of this project is to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game.  The game is to be played on the command line.  The program requests input from the user of either rock, paper, or scissors.  The user plays against the computer who randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.  The winner of each round is declared and the score is kept.  After 5 rounds whoever wins the most out of 5 is the ultimate winner!

This program was completed using javascript.  I learned the difference between local and global scope.  How to recieve input from the user with the prompt() function and also how to simulate playing against the computer.
